# flutter_grid_compare

A new Flutter project to answer [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72308391/how-to-compare-items-in-the-gridview-in-flutter/72326175#72326175) stackoverflow question

The data I am using here is from the [harry potter api](http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters). My grid will have some pictures and when 2 pictures are selected it will let the user compare them and show some data  

## What is the task?

- The task is to have data displayed in a grid
- On selecting two tiles from the grid we give the option to compare them
- When the user wants to compare the tiles we show another screen/bottom scroll sheet which then shows a datatable for comparison
